Make sure you are in the correct directory. You will not automatically start in your Desktop. You will have to `navigate` there.
Think about it like clicking through directories and windows. 
You can do this is Python using the `OS` library. 
Example 1:
Check working directory
>>> os.getcwd()
'/Users/andrewakhlaghi'

Example 2:
Get list of files and subdirectories in a directory 
>>> os.listdir()

Example 3: 
Chane working directory via relative path 
>>> os.chdir('Desktop')
>>> os.getcwd()
'/Users/andrewakhlaghi/Desktop'

Example 4: 
Change working directory via absolute path
